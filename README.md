# ikigai_barbershop_database

In this case study, I design and implement a relational database for a barbershop, focusing on customer management, appointment scheduling, inventory tracking, and financial operations. With no prior SQL knowledge, I worked to master the language by creating an ER model, translating it into SQL syntax, and handling relationships through junction tables. I also developed views to simplify queries, such as tracking low product stock and generating appointment summaries.

This case study demonstrates my learning process as I tackle real-world database challenges, showcasing my growth in SQL, data integrity, and database design.
